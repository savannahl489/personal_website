This past Friday, my family and I went to Sushi Iwa, located in Apex, NC. Having been there a few times before, we knew that they were famous for their sushi-- given in the name-- but they also had good rice plates/ dishes. This time around, we tried the mongolian beef which was just fantastic! Not only was the meat tender and not at all chewy or dry, the sauce tasted very authentic. In addition to the beef were bits of onion and what I would assume are small glass noodles. With this dish came your choice of rice-- white, brown or fried-- as well as a soup or a salad.

Sushi Iwa sells their sushi rolls as a buy one get one free deal, so of course we had to get two rolls. Sweet Dreams and Fantasy Eel were the ones that we tried and they were divine. While outward appearance makes them similar, the Sweet Dreams roll contained tempura shrimp that balanced out the salt content of the bbq eel.

Overall, the service was quite good. It was a Friday evening and so the restaurant was packed, however, we chose to order out and they were able to note down our order quickly and packaged our food quite efficiently. The waiting time that they gave us was also very accurate despite the number of customers they were serving and was pretty reasonable as well.

The [`menu`](http://www.sushiiwa.org/) can be accessed online. They do dine-in as well as curb-side pickup.
